# the qiskit practice about the course : _semiconductor qubit_.
files includes: 

  ```preface_environment```: getting start of the qiskit from set up the virual environment.
  
  ```single-qubit, two-qubit, three-or-more qubit operations, density-matrix```: Qubits formalism and Quantum circuits, basic use and commmand of the qiskit.
  
  ```Hall-Classical,Hall-corrections,Hall-SdH,sdH analysis,sDH-QHE,fenics-Hall-bar,fenics-VdP,fenics-Greek-cross```: quantum transport(linear transport theory and Boltzmann equation) and 2DCG(2 dimensional carrier gases),computing estimation of the QHE, magnetic fields at low temperature.
  
  ```bernstein-vazirani, quantum-fourier transform,quantum-phase-estimation, Grover-search,shor-factoring```: Quantum computing algorithms.
