    "[Shor's factoring algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09964) is perhaps the most famous application of quantum computing. It promises to be a fast way to factorise numbers, and since many encryption schemes are based on the fact that multiplying large numbers together is relatively fast but finding the prime factors of a large number is much slower, a shortcut here may eventually break these encryption schemes.\n",

In particular there is a discussion on how to factorize numbers other than 15.

In general, $U^r$ could actually have accumulated a phase of $2\\pi s$ for some integer $s$ and still be back at $|1\\rangle$, so if we do quantum phase estimation on $U$ we should find $\\phi = s/r$ and then we can try to find which two integers $s$ and $r$ would give that $\\phi$.\n",

The will naturally make it easier to check if a number of the form $2^n - 1$ is a [Mersenne prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime). So we can achieve what we need by being able to multiply by $x=7$, or rather by being able to perform a controlled multiply-by-7 on the register containing $|p\\rangle$ $2^n$ times according to each control qubit $n$. The control qubits will be initialized to $|+\\rangle$ states, as for quantum phase estimation.\n"
